A ten-page interim report on a description of the problem and your approach to
its solution, and/or information you have acquired from background reading.
    - You should take the opportunity to write this interim report such that it
    may be suitable for inclusion in your final report.
    - Two copies of this report should be submitted to the ITO office at the end
    of Week 2 of Semester 2; see the project calendar for more precise
    information.
I'd expect:
    - about 4-5 pages on describing the project and its goals,
    - about 3-4 pages on describing your approach, then
    - about 1-2 pages on the timeline (what you have done already, when the rest
    of the project will be done).
    - This layout will vary depending on the particular project.
    - In doing the timeline, remember you must plan to be finished system
    building by Week 4 of Semester 2 at the latest, to give time for evaluation
    and writing up.
The interim reports are scrutinized by the project supervisor, who supplies
feedback as necessary.

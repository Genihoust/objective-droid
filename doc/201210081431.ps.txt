Progress as of 8 Oct 2012 1431:
  - Summary of project: a compiler from Objective-C to Dalvik VM - Android’s VM;
  - Motivating factors:
    = Really cool if you could just compile iPhone Apps for Android
    = Apple have a reason to be happy - popularizing Obj-C
    = Google have a reason to be happy - easier to target Android
    = Developers have a reason to be happy - easier to write multiplatform apps
  - Issues:
    = Porting libraries
    = Translating iPhone idioms to Android idioms - ? -> Activities
    = DEX does not have great documentation - luckily, PhD students help (Stephen Kyle)
  - Progress:
    = Outline solution
      + Use latest LLVM/clang to produce “llvm code”
      + write backend to compile “llvm code” to “smali code”
      + use “smali” to assemble “smali code” to .dex
      + use “apktool” to package .dex to .apk
    = Set initial goal of building a benchmark solution from off-the-shelf components
      + Use LLVM/clang to produce “llvm code”
      + Use some LLVM Java backend (LLJVM) to produce “java bytecode”
      + Assemble the “java bytecode”
      + Use “dx” to convert the “java bytecode” to .dex
      + Use “apktool” to package .dex to .apk
    = Download and build LLVM/clang 3.2
    = Download LLVM/clang 2.6 and LLVM/clang 2.7 (needed by LLJVM 0.2) and attempt a build in VS 10 - but failed
      + I start to question whether I should put more effort in trying to compile LLJVM;
      + Maybe I should try on a linux machine
